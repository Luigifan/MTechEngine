    Simple SDL Game Engine

    You should've received a copy of the GNU GPL blah blah blah do things blah blah blah.

This is a (fairly) simple C++ SDL based game engine that aims to wrap SDL and make it more accessible. 
The library can be seen as an XNA styled library.

#define BUILDING_INSTRUCTIONS

# WINDOWS #
SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
SDL2_mixer: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
SDL2_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

I develop the engine in CodeBlocks using the mingw32 g++ port. As a result, you probably want to
download the mingw32 packages.

Extract all the libraries into a common place that you can find easily, you will need to link this later.

Do whatever you need to do to link the libraries and include the include directories (on Linux this is does automagically)
and make sure you include the "-lmingw32" compiler flag.
